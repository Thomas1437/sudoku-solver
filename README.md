# sudoku_solver

Creating a sudoku solver (currently not finished)

I'm using backtracking as the main solver algorithm

The board file is an example of what an expected board should look like. If board is not correct, "map error" will be displayed

The zeros in the board file represent the empty squares

Feel free to message me for any questions on the code
